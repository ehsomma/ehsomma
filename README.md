I am a software engineer passionate about technology and software solution development.

I am currently working on a large vehicle booking management project for passenger transfer (such as Cabify, Uber, DiDi, etc.), developing the apps/systems for passengers, drivers, operative management of the entire fleet of vehicles (dispatcher), shipments, cargo routing and the backend system of the entire company.

I love, apply and promote standards, best practices and good code documentation to build solutions with the best code quality.

ðŸŽ¯ Currently passionate about cryptocurrencies, <u>blockchain development</u> (`smart contracts`) and everything about the crypto world.

 <summary><b>NotePlanners</b><span style="color:grey"> (Founder and developer - 2019)</span></summary>
 <br>
 <b>NOTE</b>: This is not a code project.<br>
 Throughout my career I have found and used the best tool out there to manage a software project from start to finish, <b>OneNote</b>. This collaborative tool allows me to manage the team, carry out the project research, share or export all the information, manage the requirements and tasks, design tables and classes, do the initial prototyping, take notes, write and set the development standards, write and track test cases, integrate with Trello cards, and much more. All this in the cloud and shared with the team.<br>
 My experience with this tool led me, in my spare time, to create this personal project: YouTube Planner for OneNote.<br><br>
 The <b>YouTube Planner for OneNote</b> is a set of templates, guides and resources to plan and manage the creation and progress of a channel and the entire process of pre-production, production and post-production of YouTube videos.<br><br>
